    <!-- Data Generation -->
    <article>
        <h2>Data generation ⚙️</h2>

        <h3>Data Size</h3>
        <p>The dataset generated contains from 10 to 100 character per record, as we have 100 record (column), per row and 6000 row which makes
            about 60,000 Record,the size of the data is huge, which will overload the main thread when the app is initializing which in worse case can lead
            to the browser/tab to crash and provide terrible experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Web Worker</h3>
        <p>The generation of the dataset needs to be moved from the main thread, and that is possible with webworker. Web worker in a thread asyncly communicating with the main
            thread which is responsible for rendering the interface, the CPU intensive tasks as generating 60,000 records can run in separte thread and then destoryed to prevent
            <b>memory leak</b>.
        </p>

    <!-- Data Storage -->
    <article>
        <h2>Data Storage 💾</h2>
        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <p>The dataset has60,000 Record,the size of the data is huge, about 10MB in size. The first logical storage method is <b>Local Storage</b> which needs the 
            data to be parsed to String via <q>JSON.stringify()</q> at which the file can go nearly 35MB, and that's above the allowed quota for local storage</p>
        <h3>IndexedDB</h3>
        <p>The indexedDB is made for that purpose, it allow you to make a NO-SQL database and perform queries like MongoDB which also made for high performance queries, it runs in
            a different thread different from the main thread, which won't negatively impact the performance.
        </p>
        <h3>Dexie.js</h3>
        <p>Dexie.js is used as it provides indexedDB promise wrapper and cool functionalities and extremely small in size, as well as being well maintained</p>

        <h2>Table Editor Logic 🖊️</h2>
        <h3>Page Loading</h3>
        <p>The table page is only accessible if the User is logged and admin via guard, which checks the Token like object stored in the local storage and check the user role.</p>
        <h3>Accessing the Data</h3>
        <p>The page loads when the data is being retrieved from indexedDB, once the promise is resolved the loading spinner will fade away and the retreived data will be parsed to the table,
            the page loads extra 100 row when the page is scrolled to the bottom.
        </p>
        <h3>Editing</h3>
        <p>Each row will have a edit button which will make a query to the indexedDB and updates the value with it's ID to the Database</p>
